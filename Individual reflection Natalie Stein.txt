Individual reflection 

Questions for each week:
* What do I want to learn or understand better?
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?


Week 1:
What do I want to learn or understand better?
In the near future I would like to learn how to use Github. I want to learn github so I will be comfortable using it. 
By learning github it will be easier for everyone in my team to see what everyone has been doing and to detect problems. 


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help someone or the entire team to learn something new by always listening to their questions, and be willing to look up answers to their questions.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of scrum?
My contribution last week towards the team’s use of scrum, was that I completed my tasks that I was given. I also tried to be good at communicating and to actively participate in our discussions. 
After reflecting on last week's tasks I realized that I need to be better at planning. I often tried to rush to the solving part, without enough planning. And that is something that I would like to be better at in future tasks and assignments. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
When solving the puzzle and lego-task we got separate tasks to do. My task was to look for corner-pieces while doing the puzzle, and to look for the requested pieces while building with lego. I think it was a good idea to split the tasks. Instead of having all people working on one big task, we made it easier to complete the task by giving one small task to each person.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
To be a good listener and communicator. Try to listen to my teammates questions and try to help whenever I can. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of scrum?
Last week we did mostly planning of our project and worked on our pitch-presentation. My contribution last week towards the team’s use of scrum,

I was present the day we presented.
