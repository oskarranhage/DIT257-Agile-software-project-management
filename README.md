Agile software project management:

How to run :
To run the program, simply run the bat file Learno.bat

Note that you need to be running windows and have Java installed on your computer.
If Learno.bat does not work, a terminal based version of the program is avaliable
and can be run through running Learno-Terminal.bat.
