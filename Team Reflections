SPRINT REVIEW 1:

How did the sprint go?
It did not go as well as we hoped, but we finished most of the user stories, we failed in dividing the stories enough so some of the tasks became too “large” and gave some of the stories the wrong priority. 
The backend stories were also a little too large in scope, and we should have gone smaller for the first sprint, we nonetheless got a functional program that lets us play and create flashcard sets. 
We had a lot of meetings and that was great, but the meeting where we created stories was difficult because we didn’t know how large the workload would be before we started. 
For example, when we created a File Management Story, we realized during the coding that we could have split it up into several stories. 
They also weren't descriptive enough and that led to more confusion.

Did we complete our tasks?
Mostly yes, we successfully completed the backend and half of the frontend tasks we set up for this sprint, even though we had poor planning.
With the workload being a bit too big resulted in the program working but poorly built regarding its structure.

Did the members cooperate well?
Natalie and Anthon cooperated well. They communicated and worked together over audio calls on discord as well as meeting in person. 

Alexander, Lucas, Leo and Oskar all worked on the same project which made it hard for them to decide who should do what and in what order. 
Next time we will plan and distribute work concretely at the beginning of the sprint.

Was the workload sufficinent and/or manageable?
The workload was big for the backend, and we would have needed more structure so the load could be equal amongst all members.
The front end part was manageable, and in future sprints we could probably add one more view on the to do list. 

What needs to change until the next sprint?
We need a better structure for our meetings, for example a couple of pointers that we follow for the meetings we have on monday and friday. 
We need to set up smaller goals that we can sequentially complete, instead of promising to deliver a complete program with many steps within one sprint.
