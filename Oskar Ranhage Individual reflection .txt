We also split up the task into 3 parts Builders, materials finders and a Scrum Master,  where 2 builders and two material finders, i was a finder contributed by finding material for my assigned builder.

In the lego Session, In the first sprint we all were builders and Finders, but after doing the first sprint we split up the task into camps, and my job became to find pieces for my builder.
