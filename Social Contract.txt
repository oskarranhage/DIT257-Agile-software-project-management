SOCIAL CONTRACT UPDATE 16/9 WEEK 3
We want to add Meeting Section in our Contract that describes how our meetings should be used, 
Why we need them and creating a structure so that every meeting becomes efficient and purposeful.
Raise your hand to speak. This will help get everyone talking equally.
In the case of major decisions, each member, one at a time, must say what they think
Points we can relate to during the meetings. One for Monday and one for Friday.
Do not deal with other things during meetings, pay attention, respect each other!
The scrum master holds the meeting and is responsible for the protocol being created and followed. We create the protocol together at the end of the previous meetings.

We have decided that we have meetings on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Wednesday meetings mainly take place over discord. If necessary, we also have meetings on Tuesdays
