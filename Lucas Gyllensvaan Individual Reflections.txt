Lucas Gyllensvaan Individual Reflections


Week 1: 


* what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to use github on a more professional level, where I am able to commit, push, pull etc. This will definitely help speed things up for myself and my team, furthermore we will work better together as a team if we can review each other's contribution.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Making sure everyone’s opinion is brought forth, so that no conflicts arise and everyone feels they are part of the project. I can also help team members by reviewing their work. A team member can then get inputs from the rest of the team and improve a couple of things.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed this week with the team’s use of scrum in the jigsaw puzzle and the lego session. During the jigsaw puzzle the team reviewed their efforts and talked about how to reduce the time needed to complete the puzzle, and I along with others came up with ways for us to achieve this. During the lego sessions when we played the poker cards game before each split, we estimated how much time it would take for us to complete a building. I estimated very similarly as the other team members on how much time it would take.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Everyone in the group has assigned tasks and I contribute to the group by doing my tasks. For example in the Lego lab we had a scrum master and two people who fetched Lego pieces and two people who built the buildings. This worked fairly well, I had a fetcher who provided me with the necessary components in order for me to build the buildings that we had been assigned to complete.
