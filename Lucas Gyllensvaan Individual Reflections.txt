Lucas Gyllensvaan Individual Reflections


Week 1: 


* what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to use github on a more professional level, where I am able to commit, push, pull etc. This will definitely help speed things up for myself and my team, furthermore we will work better together as a team if we can review each other's contribution.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Making sure everyone’s opinion is brought forth, so that no conflicts arise and everyone feels they are part of the project. I can also help team members by reviewing their work. A team member can then get inputs from the rest of the team and improve a couple of things.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed this week with the team’s use of scrum in the jigsaw puzzle and the lego session. During the jigsaw puzzle the team reviewed their efforts and talked about how to reduce the time needed to complete the puzzle, and I along with others came up with ways for us to achieve this. During the lego sessions when we played the poker cards game before each split, we estimated how much time it would take for us to complete a building. I estimated very similarly as the other team members on how much time it would take.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Everyone in the group has assigned tasks and I contribute to the group by doing my tasks. For example in the Lego lab we had a scrum master and two people who fetched Lego pieces and two people who built the buildings. This worked fairly well, I had a fetcher who provided me with the necessary components in order for me to build the buildings that we had been assigned to complete. 


Week 2:

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how the group can work better following the multi layer cake model. At first we split the different components of the project into assignments and each member of the group was responsible for one of these components (horizontal slicing). However as I recently learned this is inefficient due to the fact that the client will not be able to review our work until the later sprints, when we have assembled all of the components into the final product. Since there is no presentation layer for the client, the project will have little value. We should therefore focus on developing our project by using the vertically slicing method, which I want to learn more about.     
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By using the sprint review or other retrospectives to reflect and contemplate, I ensure helping team members and reaching better teamwork within my group. Because when we reflect and review each other's efforts we can get constructive criticism, which helps us grow. As long as it’s not mean criticism, like “You did nothing good this sprint”, this doesn’t help anyone. However if it’s pointers and tips on how someone can perform even better, that person will often better themselves, me included. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have worked in sprints and have had a sprint review where we reviewed each other's work and efforts and thus we have received constructive criticism from each other. We have a couple of meetings a week, this week we meet up 4 times, because we had to come up with our project and ideas. 
 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
All of the members of the group have contributed towards the team by coming up with our project and planning how it will accomplish securing some of the UN goals. We will mostly focus on goal 4 with its targets, as previously mentioned in our representation (8th of september). I have contributed by bringing forth ideas, different variations of learning games that we plan to add to our application in the future, and in doing so expanding the functionality of the application. Furthermore, I have already thought of some solutions to how we can implement portions of our project. Such as for example how a user is able to create their own questions with either multiple choices or where you have to insert the correct answer into a textfield etc.  





Week 3:

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to be able to follow the agile practices better as previously mentioned in the week before. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Give out links. Making sure everyone’s opinion is brought forth and helping others understand things.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have had meetings and worked in a sprint and we have had a sprint review. I attend the meetings and make sure that people are heard.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I have coded it so that it’s possible to create a new flashcard (a card where you are given a question and can reveal the right answer by pressing a tangent at your keyboard). A spelling card (where you are given a question and then have to type in the correct answer). A multiple choice card (where you are given a question and alternative answers, and have to pick the correct answer out of the alternatives). When you create a new card the constructor requires you to insert a question and an answer. But if it’s a multiple choice card the constructor also requires you to put in a String array, where every String is an alternative answer. 



Week 4:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
I have yet to understand how the team should work vertically in the multi layer cake model, is it allowed that we work on different things in the backend and frontend? Some of us worked on the model of the MVC (Model, View, Controller) for this sprint, one team member worked on a database class for storing text files and its content, the others worked on how to display the sets with cards in the program. I would argue that we have worked more horizontally than vertically, but I don’t really see how we could have done this otherwise and still maintain efficiency. Is the idea that we all should have worked on the MVC for example, and when that’s done take care of the next assignment for this sprint that we had planned to complete?
  
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Review others' work and give constructive criticism to help them grow and improve. Bring forth others opinions by making sure everyone feels included. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have had meetings that I have attended, a sprint review and we have worked in a sprint this week.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I have worked to improve the existing code by following the MVC design pattern, I’ve changed the structure of the “old” code to a newer version that eliminates unnecessary dependencies etc. We had two different classes to create two different types of cards. I have removed one class and added another constructor with different parameters than the other one to the same card class, depending on the parameters it creates either this type of card or the other one via overload. I have inserted the create card methods in the card class. I have made it so that FlashSet, TextSet and MultipleChoiceSet all extend the Set class and have their own overridden run methods, where they all ask you a question and depending on which set it is you insert an answer in different ways. I have created a new class SetFactory, which contains methods for creating the different sets etc. The green painted part of the current UML shows how everything looks now, not including the others contribution, they took care of other parts of the code.
