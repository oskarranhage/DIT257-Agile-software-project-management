Week 1:
* What do I want to learn or understand better?: 
How to structure work and projects, whether they are big or small, in an efficient way. So that I can be able to avoid as many problems and conflicts in the future.


   * How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?: 
The best way, as far as I can see it, is to get the person's/team's opinion heard and understood. So that we can get a read on each other's mindsets which will cause less conflict during the project.


      * What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?: 
As the scrum master during this week’s work I was in charge of the overall direction of the work as well as communicating with the other scrum masters. To ensure that the project, which had a big work force, could result in a good outcome.


         * What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?: 
During the work I was in contact with the clients to ensure that we understood their wants for the projects and that they were met. I also had a flexible role to fill the gaps in the workload.


        Week 2:
            * What do I want to learn or understand better?: 
I want to learn more about how to do work in a vertical way (referring to the “backlog items”) and more precisely in bigger groups where everyone can’t work on the exact same thing.


            * How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?: 
        With how we worked on structuring the work this week. I’ve noticed that a great way of learning when working in a group is to showcase what you’ve done to the rest. That way one gets new ways of looking at problems and new solutions.


            * What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?: 
This week I contributed to scrum by trying to unify our group by making everyone know what everyone is working on and how. That way we can work more closely and avoid any easy misunderstandings due to miscommunication.


            * What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?: 
One of this week's deliveries was the project presentation. Which I contributed to by giving a strong connection between the projekt and the UN goal. As well as structuring the script for the presentation and lastly providing help with other parts of the script. Regrettably though, for the mockup I didn’t contribute at all as I mixed up the time for the meeting and thus missed that part.
